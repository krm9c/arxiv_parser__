arXiv:2505.09057,\\,Leveraging Offline Data from Similar Systems for Online Linear Quadr=atic  Control,"Shivam Bajaj, Prateek Jaiswal, Vijay Gupta",eess.SY cs.SY,0,"  ``Sim2real gap"", in which the system learned in simulations is not the ex= act representation of the real system, can lead to loss of stability and performance when controllers learned using data from the simulated system a= re used on the real system. In this work, we address this challenge in the lin= ear quadratic regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider an LQR problem=  for a system with unknown system matrices. Along with the state-action pairs fr= om the system to be controlled, a trajectory of length $S$ of state-action pai= rs from a different unknown system is available. Our proposed algorithm is constructed upon Thompson sampling and utilizes the mean as well as the uncertainty of the dynamics of the system from which the trajectory of leng= th $S$ is obtained. We establish that the algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({f(S,M_{\delta})\sqrt{T/S}})$ Bayes regret after $T$ t= ime steps, where $M_{\delta}$ characterizes the \emph{dissimilarity} between the two systems and $f(S,M_{\delta})$ is a function of $S$ and $M_{\delta}$. Wh= en $M_{\delta}$ is sufficiently small, the proposed algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({\sqrt{T/S}})$ Bayes regret and outperforms a naive strategy which does not utilize the available trajectory.

More specifically, we integrate the local obstacle avoidance constraint using point clouds into the NMPC framework. H= ere, each agent relies on data from its local sensor to perceive and respond to nearby obstacles. A point cloud processing technique is presented for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional point clouds to minimize the computational burden during the optimization. The process consists of directional filtering and down-sampling that significantly reduce the numbe= r of data points. The algorithm's performance is validated through realistic 3D simulations in Gazebo, and its practical feasibility is further explored via hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations on embedded platforms.
