arXiv:2505.17857,\\,Sufficient Conditions for Detectability of Approximately Discretized  Nonlinear Systems,"Seth Siriya, Julian D. Schiller, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. M\""u=ller",eess.SY cs.SY math.OC,"7 pages, submitted to 23rd European Control Conference ","  In many sampled-data applications, observers are designed based on approximately discretized models of continuous-time systems, where usually = only the discretized system is analyzed in terms of its detectability. In this paper, we show that if the continuous-time system satisfies certain linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions, and the sampling period of the discretization scheme is sufficiently small, then the whole family of discretized systems (parameterized by the sampling period) satisfies analog= ous discrete-time LMI conditions that imply detectability. Our results are applicable to general discretization schemes, as long as they produce approximate models whose linearizations are in some sense consistent with t= he linearizations of the continuous-time ones. We explicitly show that the Eul= er and second-order Runge-Kutta methods satisfy this condition. A batch-reactor system example is provided to highlight the usefulness of our results from a practical perspective. ",0.0,0.0,1.0,1
arXiv:2505.17975,\\,Preliminary Characterization of Bio-inspired Dog-Nose Sampler for  Aerosol Detection,"Yahya Naveed, Julia Gersey, Pei Zhang",eess.SY cs.SY,5 pages ,"  Before aerosols can be sensed, sampling technologies must capture the particulate matter of interest. To that end, for systems deployed in open environments where the location of the aerosol is unknown, extending the re= ach of the sampler could lessen the precision required in sensor placement or reduce the number of sensors required for full spatial coverage. Inspired by the sensitivity of the canine olfactory system, this paper presents a rudimentary sampler that mimics the air flow of a dog's nose. The design consists of speed-controlled inhalation jets, as well as exhalation jets th= at are angled down and to the side. We tested this design on volatile organic compounds (VOC) in a small number of scenarios to validate the concept and understand how the system behaves. We show that in preliminary testing this dog-nose setup provides improvements over passive and solely inhalation sensing. ",0.0,0.0,1.0,1
