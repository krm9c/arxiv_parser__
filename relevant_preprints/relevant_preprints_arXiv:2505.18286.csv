arXiv:2505.18336,\\,"Sampled-data Systems: Stability, Contractivity and Single-iteration  Suboptimal MPC","Yiting Chen, Francesco Bullo, Emiliano Dall'Anese",eess.SY cs.SY math.OC,0,"  This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) = and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T&gt;0$ = by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem.   We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting beha= vior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration co= unt $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for = all sampling periods $T &lt; T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that = both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of the= ir interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guaran= tees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.

arXiv:2505.18590 (*cross-list,\\,Optimization-Based Trajectory Planning for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles =on  Curvy Roads: A Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Method,"Zehao Wang, Han Zhang, Jingchuan Wang, Weidong Chen",cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY,0,"  In this work, we propose an optimization-based trajectory planner for tractor-trailer vehicles on curvy roads. The lack of analytical expression = for the trailer's errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orienta= tion errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discreti= ze the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in t= he number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization probl= em difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increa= sing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increa= sed, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved = in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling num= ber. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks. ",0.0,0.0,2.0,1
