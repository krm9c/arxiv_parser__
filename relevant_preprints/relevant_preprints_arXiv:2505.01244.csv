arXiv:2505.01244,\\,A CFL-type Condition and Theoretical Insights for Discrete-Time Spar=se  Full-Order Model Inference,"Leonidas Gkimisis, S\""uleyman Y{\i}ld{\i}z, Peter Benner, Thomas  Richter",math.DS cs.NA math.NA,0,"  In this work, we investigate the data-driven inference of a discrete-time dynamical system via a sparse Full-Order Model (sFOM). We first formulate t= he involved Least Squares (LS) problem and discuss the need for regularization, indicating a connection between the typically employed $l_2$ regularization=  and the stability of the inferred discrete-time sFOM. We then provide theoretic= al insights considering the consistency and stability properties of the inferr= ed numerical schemes that form the sFOM and exemplify them via illustrative, 1D test cases of linear diffusion and linear advection. For linear advection, = we analytically derive a ""sampling CFL"" condition, which dictates a bound for = the ratio of spatial and temporal discretization steps in the training data that ensures stability of the inferred sFOM. Finally, we investigate the sFOM inference for two nonlinear problems, namely a 2D Burgers' test case and the incompressible flow in an oscillating lid driven cavity, and draw connectio= ns between the theoretical findings and the properties of the inferred, nonlin= ear sFOMs. ",0.0,0.0,1.0,1
