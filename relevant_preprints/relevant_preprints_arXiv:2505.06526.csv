arXiv:2505.07143,\\,Subgradient Regularization: A Descent-Oriented Subgradient Method for  Nonsmooth Optimization,"Hanyang Li, Ying Cui",math.OC,"42 pages, 7 figures MSC-class: 90C26, 90C31, 49J52, 65K10 ","  In nonsmooth optimization, a negative subgradient is not necessarily a descent direction, making the design of convergent descent methods based on zeroth-order and first-order information a challenging task. The well-studi= ed bundle methods and gradient sampling algorithms construct descent direction= s by aggregating subgradients at nearby points in seemingly different ways, and = are often complicated or lack deterministic guarantees. In this work, we identi= fy a unifying principle behind these approaches, and develop a general framework=  of descent methods under the abstract principle that provably converge to stationary points. Within this framework, we introduce a simple yet effecti= ve technique, called subgradient regularization, to generate stable descent directions for a broad class of nonsmooth marginal functions, including fin= ite maxima or minima of smooth functions. When applied to the composition of a convex function with a smooth map, the method naturally recovers the prox-linear method and, as a byproduct, provides a new dual interpretation = of this classical algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectivene= ss of our methods on several challenging classes of nonsmooth optimization problems, including the minimization of Nesterov's nonsmooth Chebyshev-Rosenbrock function.

Zeilinger",eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY math.OC,0,"  Gaussian Process (GP) regression is shown to be effective for learning unknown dynamics, enabling efficient and safety-aware control strategies ac= ross diverse applications. However, existing GP-based model predictive control (GP-MPC) methods either rely on approximations, thus lacking guarantees, or=  are overly conservative, which limits their practical utility. To close this ga= p, we present a sampling-based framework that efficiently propagates the model= 's epistemic uncertainty while avoiding conservatism. We establish a novel sam= ple complexity result that enables the construction of a reachable set using a finite number of dynamics functions sampled from the GP posterior. Building=  on this, we design a sampling-based GP-MPC scheme that is recursively feasible=  and guarantees closed-loop safety and stability with high probability. Finally,=  we showcase the effectiveness of our method on two numerical examples, highlighting accurate reachable set over-approximation and safe closed-loop performance. ",0.0,0.0,1.0,1
