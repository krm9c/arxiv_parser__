arXiv:2505.20927,\\,Uncertainty Partitioning with Probabilistic Feasibility and Performa=nce  Guarantees for Chance-Constrained Optimization,"Francesco Cordiano, Matin Jafarian, Bart De Schutter",math.OC cs.SY eess.SY,Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control ,"  We propose a novel distribution-free scheme to solve optimization problems where the goal is to minimize the expected value of a cost function subject=  to probabilistic constraints. Unlike standard sampling-based methods, our idea consists of partitioning the uncertainty domain in a user-defined number of sets, enabling more flexibility in the trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that o= ur approximated problem is feasible for the original stochastic program, in te= rms of chance constraint satisfaction. In addition, we perform a rigorous performance analysis, by quantifying the distance between the optimal value= s of the original and the approximated problem. We show that our approach is tractable for optimization problems that include model predictive control of piecewise affine systems, and we demonstrate the benefits of our approach, = in terms of the trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity, o= n a numerical example.

arXiv:2505.21161 (*cross-list,\\,Collision Probability Estimation for Optimization-based Vehicular Mo=tion  Planning,"Leon Tolksdorf, Arturo Tejada, Christian Birkner, Nathan van de Wo=uw",cs.RO math.OC,"14 pages, 6 figures ","  Many motion planning algorithms for automated driving require estimating = the probability of collision (POC) to account for uncertainties in the measurem= ent and estimation of the motion of road users. Common POC estimation techniques often utilize sampling-based methods that suffer from computational inefficiency and a non-deterministic estimation, i.e., each estimation resu= lt for the same inputs is slightly different. In contrast, optimization-based motion planning algorithms require computationally efficient POC estimation, ideally using deterministic estimation, such that typical optimization algorithms for motion planning retain feasibility. Estimating the POC analytically, however, is challenging because it depends on understanding t= he collision conditions (e.g., vehicle's shape) and characterizing the uncerta= inty in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose an approach in which we estimate the POC between two vehicles by over-approximating their shapes by=  a multi-circular shape approximation. The position and heading of the predict= ed vehicle are modelled as random variables, contrasting with the literature, where the heading angle is often neglected. We guarantee that the provided = POC is an over-approximation, which is essential in providing safety guarantees, and present a computationally efficient algorithm for computing the POC estimate for Gaussian uncertainty in the position and heading. This algorit= hm is then used in a path-following stochastic model predictive controller (SM= PC) for motion planning. With the proposed algorithm, the SMPC generates reproducible trajectories while the controller retains its feasibility in t= he presented test cases and demonstrates the ability to handle varying levels = of uncertainty.
