arXiv:2507.14409,\\,Collaborative Indirect Influencing and Control on Graphs using Graph  Neural Networks,"Max L. Gardenswartz, Brandon C. Fallin, Cristian F. Nino, and Warr=en  E. Dixon",eess.SY cs.SY,arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.15360 ,"  This paper presents a novel approach to solving the indirect influence problem in networked systems, in which cooperative nodes must regulate a ta= rget node with uncertain dynamics to follow a desired trajectory. We leverage the message-passing structure of a graph neural network (GNN), allowing nodes to collectively learn the unknown target dynamics in real time. We develop a n= ovel GNN-based backstepping control strategy with formal stability guarantees derived from a Lyapunov-based analysis. Numerical simulations are included = to demonstrate the performance of the developed controller. ",1.0,0.0,0.0,1

Mamduhi, Abolfazl Lavaei",eess.SY cs.SY,0,"  This paper develops a framework for synthesizing safety controllers for discrete-time stochastic linear control systems (dt-SLS) operating under communication imperfections. The control unit is remote and communicates wi= th the sensor and actuator through an imperfect wireless network. We consider a constant delay in the sensor-to-controller channel (uplink), and data loss = in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator (downlink) channels. In our proposed scheme, data loss in each channel is modeled as an independent Bernoulli-distributed random process. To systematically handle the uplink delay, we first introduce an augmented discrete-time stochastic linear syst= em (dt-ASLS) by concatenating all states and control inputs that sufficiently represent the state-input evolution of the original dt-SLS under the delay = and packet loss constraints. We then leverage control barrier certificates (CBC= s) for dt-ASLS to synthesize a controller that guarantees dt-SLS safety in a stochastic sense, ensuring that all trajectories of dt-SLS remain within sa= fe regions with a quantified probabilistic bound. Our approach translates safe= ty constraints into matrix inequalities, leading to an optimization problem th= at eventually quantifies the probability of satisfying the safety specificatio= n in the presence of communication imperfections. We validate our results on an = RLC circuit subject to both constant delay and probabilistic data loss. ",1.0,0.0,0.0,1

The problem of designing revenue-optimal auctions based on reserve price has drawn much attention in=  the auction design community. Although they have been extensively studied, most developments rely on the significant assumption that the target audience of=  the sale is directly reachable by the auctioneer, while a large portion of bidd= ers in the economic network unaware of the sale are omitted. This work follows = the diffusion auction design, which aims to extend the target audience of optim= al auction theory to all entities in economic networks. We investigate the des= ign of simple and provably near-optimal network auctions via reserve price. Usi= ng Bayesian approximation analysis, we provide a simple and explicit form of t= he reserve price function tailored to the most representative network auction.=  We aim to balance setting a sufficiently high reserve price to induce high rev= enue in a successful sale, and attracting more buyers from the network to increa= se the probability of a successful sale. This reserve price function preserves incentive compatibility for network auctions, allowing the seller to extract additional revenue beyond that achieved by the Myerson optimal auction. Specifically, if the seller has $\rho$ direct neighbours in a network of si= ze $n$, this reserve price guarantees a $1-{1 \over \rho}$ approximation to the theoretical upper bound, i.e., the maximum possible revenue from any networ= k of size $n$. This result holds for any size and any structure of the networked market. ",1.0,0.0,0.0,1

These measurements typically exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics across different regions, which significantly challenges the generalization abilit= y of detection models. Traditional centralized training approaches not only face privacy risks and data sharing constraints but also incur high transmission costs, limiting their scalability and deployment feasibility. To address th= ese issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framewo= rk, termed Federated Cluster Average (FedClusAvg), designed to improve FDIA detection in Non-IID and resource-constrained environments. FedClusAvg incorporates cluster-based stratified sampling and hierarchical communicati= on (client-subserver-server) to enhance model generalization and reduce communication overhead. By enabling localized training and weighted paramet= er aggregation, the algorithm achieves accurate model convergence without centralizing sensitive data. Experimental results on benchmark smart grid datasets demonstrate that FedClusAvg not only improves detection accuracy u= nder heterogeneous data distributions but also significantly reduces communicati= on rounds and bandwidth consumption.

One challenge that we face in addressing the considered problem is the inapplicability of existing resilient decision algorithms designed for one-dimensional multi-agent systems. This is because the networked Euler-Lagrange systems fall into the category of multi-dimensional multi-agent systems with coupling among state vector components. To address this problem, we propose a new resilient decision algorithm. This algorithm constructs auxiliary variables related to the coordinative objectives for each normal agent, and transforms the considered resilient consensus problem into the consensus problem of the designed auxiliary variables. Furthermore, to relax the constraints imposed on Byzan= tine agent behavior patterns within continuous-time scenarios, the event-trigger= ed communication scheme is adopted. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through case studies. ",2.0,0.0,0.0,1
