arXiv:2505.07835 (*cross-list,\\,Intelligent Product 3.0: Decentralised AI Agents and Web3 Intelligen=ce  Standards,"Alex C. Y. Wong, Duncan McFarlane, C. Ellarby, M. Lee, and M. Kuok",cs.NI cs.AI cs.MA,"18 pages, 1 Figure, 3 Tables ACM-class: I.2.11; C.3; C.2.4 ","  Twenty-five years ago, the specification of the Intelligent Product was established, envisaging real-time connectivity that not only enables produc= ts to gather accurate data about themselves but also allows them to assess and influence their own destiny. Early work by the Auto-ID project focused on creating a single, open-standard repository for storing and retrieving prod= uct information, laying a foundation for scalable connectivity. A decade later,=  the approach was revisited in light of low-cost RFID systems that promised a low-cost link between physical goods and networked information environments. Since then, advances in blockchain, Web3, and artificial intelligence have introduced unprecedented levels of resilience, consensus, and autonomy. By leveraging decentralised identity, blockchain-based product information and history, and intelligent AI-to-AI collaboration, this paper examines these developments and outlines a new specification for the Intelligent Product 3= .0, illustrating how decentralised and AI-driven capabilities facilitate seamle= ss interaction between physical AI and everyday products.

arXiv:2505.08216 (*cross-list,\\,Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Qu=ery,"Bowen Weng, Linda Capito, Guillermo A. Castillo, Dylan Khor",cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY,0,"  For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a speci= fic aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly impo= sed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth refere= nce) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equip= ment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject ro= bot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability=  at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expec= ted value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We pro= pose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenario= s: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (i= i) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracki= ng performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.

arXiv:2505.08229 (*cross-list,\\,Constrained Factor Graph Optimization for Robust Networked Pedestrian  Inertial Navigation,Yingjie Hu and Wang Hu,cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY,"6 pages, 5 figures. Accepted by 2025 IEEE/ION Position, Location = and   Navigation Symposium (PLANS) ","  This paper presents a novel constrained Factor Graph Optimization (FGO)-b= ased approach for networked inertial navigation in pedestrian localization. To effectively mitigate the drift inherent in inertial navigation solutions, we incorporate kinematic constraints directly into the nonlinear optimization framework. Specifically, we utilize equality constraints, such as Zero-Velo= city Updates (ZUPTs), and inequality constraints representing the maximum allowa= ble distance between body-mounted Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) based on hu= man anatomical limitations. While equality constraints are straightforwardly integrated as error factors, inequality constraints cannot be explicitly represented in standard FGO formulations. To address this, we introduce a differentiable softmax-based penalty term in the FGO cost function to enfor= ce inequality constraints smoothly and robustly. The proposed constrained FGO approach leverages temporal correlations across multiple epochs, resulting = in optimal state trajectory estimates while consistently maintaining constraint satisfaction. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms conventional Kalman filter approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for pedestrian navigation. ",2.0,0.0,0.0,1
