arXiv:2507.18030 (*cross-list,\\,Sparse optimal control for infinite-dimensional linear systems with  applications to graphon control,"Takuya Ikeda, Masaaki Nagahara",math.OC cs.SY eess.SY,16 pages ,"  Large-scale networked systems typically operate under resource constraint= s, and it is also difficult to exactly obtain the network structure between no= des. To address these issues, this paper investigates a sparse optimal control f= or infinite-dimensional linear systems and its application to networked systems where the network structure is represented by a limit function called a gra= phon that captures the overall connection pattern. The contributions of this pap= er are twofold: (i) To reduce computational complexity, we derive a sufficient condition under which the sparse optimal control can be obtained by solving=  its corresponding L1 optimization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a class of non-convex optimal control problems such that the optimal solution always coincides with a sparse optimal control, provided that the non-convex probl= ems admit optimal solutions. (ii) We show that the sparse optimal control for large-scale finite-dimensional networked systems can be approximated by tha= t of the corresponding limit graphon system, provided that the underlying graph = is close to the limit graphon in the cut-norm topology. The effectiveness of t= he proposed approach is illustrated through numerical examples. ",1.0,0.0,0.0,1
