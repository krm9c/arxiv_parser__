arXiv:2505.06473,\\,Joint Parameterization of Hybrid Physics-Based and Machine Learning  Li-Ion Battery Model,Jackson Fogelquist and Xinfan Lin,eess.SY cs.SY,"7 pages, 2 figures, to be published in the 2025 American Control   Conference proceedings ","  Electrochemical hybrid battery models have major potential to enable adva= nced physics-based control, diagnostic, and prognostic features for next-generat= ion lithium-ion battery management systems. This is due to the physical significance of the electrochemical model, which is complemented by a machi= ne learning model that compensates for output prediction errors caused by syst= em uncertainties. While hybrid models have demonstrated robust output predicti= on performance under large system uncertainties, they are highly susceptible to the influence of uncertainties during parameter identification, which can compromise the physical significance of the model. To address this challeng= e, we present a parameter estimation framework that explicitly considers system uncertainties through a discrepancy function. The approach also incorporate= s a downsampling procedure to address the computational barriers associated with large time-series data sets, as are typical in the battery domain. The framework was validated in simulation, yielding several mean parameter estimation errors that were one order of magnitude smaller than those of the conventional least squares approach. While developed for the high-uncertain= ty, electrochemical hybrid modeling context, the estimation framework is applic= able to all models and is presented in a generalized form. ",0.0,0.0,1.0,1
arXiv:2505.07234,\\,A Novel Online Pseudospectral Method for Approximation of Nonlinear  Systems Dynamics,"Arian Yousefian, Avimanyu Sahoo and Vignesh Narayanan",eess.SY cs.SY,"12 pages, 4 figures, Substantially extends our earlier paper acce= pted   for ACC 2025 (Denver, 8 Jul 2025). Submitted to IEEE Transactions on   Automatic Control; under review ","  This paper presents a novel online system identification approach utilizi= ng the Chebyshev pseudospectral (PS) method to approximate the dynamics of a continuous-time nonlinear system. Unlike conventional periodic sampling, the proposed identification scheme employs aperiodic state sampling, leveraging=  the Chebyshev nodes to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. Unlike traditional off-line PS approaches, the scheme utilizes a moving time-window strategy to compute the sampling instants (Chebyshev nodes) forward in time=  for state measurements. Within each time window, the number of sampling instant= s is adaptively determined to meet the specified approximation accuracy. The Chebyshev basis is also shifted for each time window to accommodate arbitra= ry approximation intervals. The least-squares approach is employed to estimate=  the coefficients of the shifted Chebyshev basis functions using the measured st= ate and its derivatives at the end of each window, resulting in a piecewise approximation of the drift dynamics of the system. In the second step, the identified drift dynamics are utilized to design an adaptive state estimato= r to reconstruct the continuous system states from the aperiodic state measureme= nts. To address the smoothness of the piecewise approximated system dynamics, the Chebyshev coefficients are recomputed at the window transition instants, between two consecutive time windows, by enforcing continuity of the approximated function and its derivatives. In addition, analytical results = are provided to determine the number of sampling instants within each time wind= ow, which guarantees the desired approximation accuracy. The boundedness of function approximation and state estimation errors is also proved analytica= lly. Finally, numerical simulation results are included to validate the proposed scheme.

Zeilinger",eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY math.OC,0,"  Gaussian Process (GP) regression is shown to be effective for learning unknown dynamics, enabling efficient and safety-aware control strategies ac= ross diverse applications. However, existing GP-based model predictive control (GP-MPC) methods either rely on approximations, thus lacking guarantees, or=  are overly conservative, which limits their practical utility. To close this ga= p, we present a sampling-based framework that efficiently propagates the model= 's epistemic uncertainty while avoiding conservatism. We establish a novel sam= ple complexity result that enables the construction of a reachable set using a finite number of dynamics functions sampled from the GP posterior. Building=  on this, we design a sampling-based GP-MPC scheme that is recursively feasible=  and guarantees closed-loop safety and stability with high probability. Finally,=  we showcase the effectiveness of our method on two numerical examples, highlighting accurate reachable set over-approximation and safe closed-loop performance. ",0.0,0.0,1.0,1
arXiv:2505.07126 (*cross-list,\\,AI-Driven Optimization of Wave-Controlled Reconfigurable Intelligent  Surfaces,Gal Ben Itzhak and Miguel Saavedra-Melo and Ender Ayanoglu and Fil=ippo  Capolino and A. Lee Swindlehurst,cs.ET cs.SY eess.SP eess.SY,"22 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables ","  A promising type of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) employs tuna= ble control of its varactors using biasing transmission lines below the RIS reflecting elements. Biasing standing waves (BSWs) are excited by a time-periodic signal and sampled at each RIS element to create a desired biasing voltage and control the reflection coefficients of the elements. A simple rectifier can be used to sample the voltages and capture the peaks of the BSWs over time. Like other types of RIS, attempting to model and accura= tely configure a wave-controlled RIS is extremely challenging due to factors suc= h as device non-linearities, frequency dependence, element coupling, etc., and t= hus significant differences will arise between the actual and assumed performan= ce. An alternative approach to solving this problem is data-driven: Using train= ing data obtained by sampling the reflected radiation pattern of the RIS for a = set of BSWs, a neural network (NN) is designed to create an input-output map between the BSW amplitudes and the resulting sampled radiation pattern. Thi= s is the approach discussed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the NN is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the error between the predicted and measured radiation patterns. The BSW amplitudes are then desi= gned via Simulated Annealing (SA) to optimize a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise rat= io measure by iteratively forward-propagating the BSW amplitudes through the NN and using its output as feedback to determine convergence. The resulting optimal solutions are stored in a lookup table to be used both as settings = to instantly configure the RIS and as a basis for determining more complex radiation patterns.
