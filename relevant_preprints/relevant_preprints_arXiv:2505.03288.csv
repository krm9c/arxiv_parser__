arXiv:2505.03468,\\,Multi-Class Stackelberg Games for the Co-Design of Networked Systems,"Julian Barreiro-Gomez, Ye Wang",eess.SY cs.SY math.OC,0,"  We investigate a co-design problem, encompassing simultaneous design of system infrastructure and control, through a game-theoretical framework. To this end, we propose the co-design problem as a two-layer hierarchical strategic interaction. At the upper layer, a leader (or multiple leaders) determines system design parameters, while at the lower layer, a follower (= or multiple followers) optimizes the control strategy. To capture this hierarc= hy, we propose four novel classes of Stackelberg games that integrate diverse strategic behaviors, including combinations of cooperative and non-cooperat= ive interactions across two different layers. Notably, the leaders' interactions are represented using a normal-form game, whereas the followers' interactio= ns are modeled by different games (dynamic games in discrete time). These dist= inct game structures result in a Stackelberg game that accommodates different ga= me types per layer, and/or supports heterogeneous strategic behaviors involving cooperation and non-cooperation simultaneously. Learning algorithms using t= he best-response dynamics are used to solve the game problems when considering=  a discrete strategic space for the leaders. The efficacy of the proposed appr= oach is demonstrated through an application to the co-design of the Barcelona drinking water network. ",1.0,0.0,0.0,1
