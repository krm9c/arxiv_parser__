J.   Differential Equations, 268(12):7669-7714, 2020. We are grateful to A. Di= cke   for pointing out an error in the original publication. Here we present a   corrected version. Only Sections 4 and 6 needed to be modified. All the   results formulated in Sections 2 and 3 of [TV-20] are correct as stated   there. For details, consult the paper ","  We consider elliptic second order partial differential operators with Lipschitz continuous leading order coefficients on finite cubes and the who= le Euclidean space. We prove quantitative sampling and equidistribution theore= ms for eigenfunctions. The estimates are scale-free, in the sense that for a sequence of growing cubes we obtain uniform estimates. These results are applied to prove lifting of eigenvalues as well as the infimum of the essen= tial spectrum, and an uncertainty relation (aka spectral inequality) for short energy interval spectral projectors. Several application including random operators are discussed. In the proof we have to overcome several challenges posed by the variable coefficients of the leading term. ",0.0,0.0,2.0,1
